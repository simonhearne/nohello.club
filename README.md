# The No Hello Club

## Why?

Unnecessary pleasantries waste time and effort. In the No Hello Club we never start an interaction with a useless phrase such as "Hello!".

If someone has shared this with you or has this link in their profile, it means they won't be offended if you skip the pleasantries and get straight to the point.

Consider this conversation:

> Hello!

> Hey

> Can I ask you a question?

> Sure

> Awesome! My question is...

> This is the answer

> Aw jeez, so simple. Thanks!

To get the answer took seven messages. With each message potentially adding minutes of delay thanks to context-switching.

*Another common pattern:*

> Hello, how are you?

> Hey, I'm good thanks! And you?

> I'm super awesome!

> Can I ask you a question?

> Sure

> Awesome! My question is...

> This is the answer

> Aw jeez, so simple. Thanks!

To get the answer in this case took eight messages with some thinly veiled pleasantries.

*The most effective method of asking the question? Just ask the question!*

> Hello, I hope you are well!
> I have a question about xyz: My question is...

> Hey, I'm good thanks! This is the answer.

> Aw jeez, so simple. Thanks!

*Being succinct and effective does not have to be rude,
in fact it demonstrates respect for the other person's time.*
